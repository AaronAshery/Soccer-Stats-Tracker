# Soccer-Stats-Tracker

My first relatively large project I ever coded. THe program was inspired by the NCAA's version which I used working at women's soccer matches.
I felt that certain features and UI could be better so I chose that for my end of semester project in my introductory Python course. The program is meant to be used to keep track of every stat during a live soccer match. It starts by asking the user to fill in all the players for each team, then waits until the real game starts so that the timer coincides with the live time. As events happen in the game, the user records them. When the game is finished, a visually appealing box-score comes up with all the players statistics from the game.
